# hello-world
An introductory repository to show me how to make code repositories.
I am well educated and pretty smart, but I obviously have toruble following directions.  OK, so, this message is going to get incorporated in all that I have done so far.  Perhaps a user will need to open the file up, throw everything I have done away, and start again.
